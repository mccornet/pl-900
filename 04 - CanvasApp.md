>
>Power Apps generates the app by inspecting your data and matching it with Power Apps capabilities so that you get a working app as a starting point. Generated apps are always based on a single list or table, but you can add more data to the app later.
>
>### Explore the generated app
>
>Your new three-screen app now opens in Power Apps Studio. The following figure shows the main development window for Power Apps Studio.
>
>[![App editor view](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/build-app-solution/media/power-apps-edit.png)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/build-app-solution/media/power-apps-edit.png#lightbox)
>
>Select Play ![Start app preview arrow](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/build-app-solution/media/forward-arrow.png) in the upper-right corner to practice using the app. Notice that it includes all the data from the table and provides a good default experience. All apps that are generated from data have the same set of screens that you can view from the Screens pane:
>
>- **Browse screen** - This screen appears by default. In it, you can browse, sort, search, and refresh the data from the data source. In the browse screen, you can add items to the data source by selecting the plus sign (**+**).
>- **Details screen** - The details screen shows all information about a single item. In this screen, you can open an item to edit or delete it.
>- **Edit/create screen** - In this screen, you can edit an existing item or create a new one.
>
>Close out of preview mode by selecting the "X" in the upper-right corner. To make your app visible on the phone, it needs to be saved. Select **File**, **Save as**. Replace the current title "App" with **Contoso Site Tracking app**, and then select **Save**. You will see a green check mark when all changes are successfully saved. You can now open the app on your phone.
>
>### Install the app on your device
>
>To see how the app runs on mobile, install the Power Apps Mobile app on your phone. 
>
>1. Download Power Apps Mobile 
>2. Sign in 
>3. On your phone or tablet, run the **Contoso Site Tracking app** in Power Apps Mobile.

## Controls in Power Apps

***A control is a UI element that produces an action or shows information***. Many controls in Power Apps are similar to controls that you've used in other apps: labels, text-input boxes, drop-down lists, navigation elements, and so on. In addition to these typical controls, Power Apps has more specialized controls, which you can find on the Insert tab.

<p align="center">
	<img src="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/build-app-solution/media/control-type-list.png" alt="Control type list" width="750px" />
</p>

### A few controls:

- **Galleries** - ***layout containers that hold a set of controls that show rows from a data source.***
- **Forms** -  ***show details about the data and allows creation and editing of records***.
- **Media** - ***add background images, include a camera button, a barcode reader, and more.***
- **Charts** - ***add charts to allow instant analysis***.

## Functions

***Formulas are used to express logic in an app and control its navigation, filtering, sorting, and other functionality. It is possible to combine one or more formulas with the required and optional parameters***. 

### Common Functions

- **Filter** -  ***narrow down the rows by specifying column(s) to perform a logic test on***.
- **Match** - ***Check if a value follows a given pattern; serves well for conditional formatting.***
- **Distinct** -  ***return the unique values from a list of data***
- **Math functions** - ***Math formulas like in Excel***

A complete list of all of the functions available can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/formula-reference#s). 

## Sharing an App

***Sharing the app is the final step as an app creator. Share the app to test the full functionality with some stakeholders***. This will give them a chance to provide feedback. When you share an app, they can run it in a browser, or in the players for Apple iOS and Google Android. It is  possible to give someone permission to update the app.

<details>
<summary>Tutorial to Share an App</summary>

**To share an app** complete the following steps, open the app that you want to share in Edit mode.

1. In Power Apps Studio, select the **File** menu and then select **Save as** and then select **The cloud**.

2. Click **Save** in the bottom right corner.

3. After the app is successfully saved click **Share**.

4. On the Share tab, specify the users or groups with whom you want to share the app. To add everyone in your organization, type Everyone and select **Everyone** in **Company Name**. If you need to share with a large group of users, a best practice is to share through an Azure Active Directory Security Group.

   By default, the user receives the User permission. If you want the user to also be able to edit the app, then select the co-owner check box. The following is a description of both permissions:

   - **Co-owner** - Users can use, edit, and share the app, but can't delete or change the owner.
   - **User** - Users can view and use the app, but they can't change it.

5. Consider security groups.

   - If you share an app with a security group, existing members of that group and anyone who joins it will have the permission that you specify for that group. Anyone who leaves the group loses that permission unless they belong to a different group that has access or if you give them permission as an individual.
   - Every member of a security group has the same permission for an app as the overall group does. However, you can specify greater permissions for one or more members of that group to allow them greater access. For example, you can give Security Group A permission to run an app, but you can also give User B, who belongs to that group, Co-owner permission. Every member of the security group can run the app, but only User B can edit it. If you give Security Group A Co-owner permission and User B permission to run the app, User B can still edit the app.

6. To notify users by email, leave the **Send an email invitation to new users** check box selected.

   If you select to notify the users by email, everyone you shared the app with will receive an email message that has a link to the app. People whom you granted Co-owner permission for the app will also receive a link to Edit App in Power Apps Studio.

7. Click **Share**.

   If you make and save changes to a shared app, the people whom you shared it with will see your changes as soon as you publish them. This can be useful if you improve the app, but it can also negatively affect users if you remove or significantly change features. Remember to create a notification plan for alerting your users of major updates.

### Permissions and licensing

**Some basic information about permissions and licensing:**

- Users and contributors need permissions to any data connections and gateways that a shared app uses.
- Some permissions come implicitly with the app, but you must explicitly grant others.
- If you create an app based on Microsoft Dataverse, you must also ensure that the users with whom you share the app have the appropriate permissions for the table or tables on which the app relies. Specifically, those users must belong to a security role that can perform tasks such as creating, reading, writing, and deleting relevant rows.
- In many cases, there is a need to create one or more custom security roles with the exact permissions that users need to run the app.
