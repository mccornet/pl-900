# PL-910 Power Apps

Power Apps is used to ***build apps that allow you to take action on your data***. Once built on the web native Power Apps platform, these apps live in the cloud and can be easily shared and run on a variety of platforms including PCs, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones.

Power Apps is a ***no-code/low-code platform*** for building apps that builds off of concepts similar to formulas in an Excel workbook such as SUM and TEXT. If you can envision an app to solve a business problem, then you can use your existing skills to build it. Although geared towards business users with little background in computer science and coding, Power Apps offers advanced functionality and the ability for seasoned developers to design complex applications with ease.

With over 275 ***connectors to easily connect to data***, using the underlying data service and app platform, Microsoft Dataverse, or a multitude of online and on-premises data sources. Some common data sources include: Dataverse, SharePoint, Dynamics 365, SQL Server and Azure SQL,Office 365 Power Apps easily ***supports multiple data connections*** allowing you to bring data together from many platforms into a single app.

### Types of Power Apps

Power Apps can create ***three types of apps***: 

#### Canvas apps

Canvas apps are a great option when you want to build an app from a blank canvas. Start by choosing the screen size: ***tablet (also good for pc) or mobile***, then you have a blank screen from which to build. Interact with data in the app by adding data sources. Drag and drop various controls and add the desired functionality by writing Excel style formulas. 

#### Model-driven apps

Model-driven apps build from data in Microsoft Dataverse. With model-driven apps, there is no need to worry about choosing the app size; it is responsive, meaning it works on mobile or tablet with no extra work by you. You ***define the relationships, forms, views, business rules, and more at the data layer***, inside of the Dataverse, giving you enough control to get your business result without writing all of the formulas yourself.

#### Portals

Portals bring the power of no-code solutions to building ***externally facing websites***. Through the Power Apps interface, you can build an anonymous or authenticated website that allows users to interact with data held in Dataverse. 

### Artificial Intelligence

***Power Apps has "democratized" artificial intelligence by providing a wizard-based interface for building and training a model***. This unlocks the power of Azure Machine Learning and Cognitive services without writing a single line of code or creating complex machine learning models.

***Currently four AI models:***

- **Prediction** - predicts whether something will happen or not based on previous data history. 
- **Form processor** - extracts text from an image like the business card reader.
- **Object detector** - identifies objects from an uploaded image or taken photo and then provides a count of the number of objects present.
- **Text classification** - categorizes text by its meaning, making it is easier to analyze.

### The Prediction Model

The AI Builder prediction model allows you to create ***a model that can predict yes or no outcomes based on historical data***. You train the model by providing historical data that includes the yes/no outcome and then artificial intelligence does the rest.

### Security and Administration

***Power Apps has a multitude of security, governance, and reporting capabilities to let you manage Power Apps. Users cannot build apps to bypass current access permissions***. To manage security for Power Apps, you can access https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/. Here you will find options for creating and managing environments, monitoring licenses, working with Data Loss Prevention policies and managing Dataverse Data Integration projects. 

***Power Apps also has its own set of PowerShell cmdlets for app creators, administrators, and developers that allow you to automate many of your administrative duties***. A common use case of the PowerShell cmdlets is to automate the discovery and permission management of all apps in your tenant, allowing you to better understand and manage apps as they are created and spread throughout your company.

In addition, in the Power Automate learn module, you will see that ***Power Automate has the ability to automate tasks using flows***. 

### Driving business value

Power Apps does not require traditional "code" like C#, making a low technology barrier to entry. ***If you know your business process, you can get started writing your first app.*** The same way Finance builds their own Excel workbooks today, they can build their own Power Apps. Power Apps allows even the most entry level users to ***reduce paperwork by building apps with ease, while staying within the guardrails set by IT***.
