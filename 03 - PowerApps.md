# PL-910 Power Apps

***Power Apps is is a no-code/low-code platform used to build apps that allow users to take data-based action***. Once built on the web native Power Apps platform, these apps live in the cloud and can be easily shared and run on a variety of platforms including PCs, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones. Building off of concepts similar to formulas in an Excel workbook such as SUM and TEXT. If you can envision an app to solve a business problem, then you can use your existing skills to build it. Although geared towards business users with little background in computer science and coding, Power Apps offers advanced functionality and the ability for seasoned developers to design complex applications with ease.

***It uses connectors to connect to data and supports multiple data connections to allow data from many platforms into a single app***, using the underlying data service and app platform, Microsoft Dataverse, or a multitude of online and on-premises data sources. Some common data sources include: Dataverse, SharePoint, Dynamics 365, SQL Server and Azure SQL,Office 365. Power Apps supports multiple data connections allowing you to bring data together from many platforms into a single app.

### Types of Power Apps

#### 1. Canvas apps

***Canvas build an app from a blank canvas; two screen sizes: tablet (also good for pc) or mobile.***  Interact with data in the app by adding data sources. Drag and drop various controls and add the desired functionality by writing Excel style formulas. 

#### 2. Model-driven apps

***Model-driven apps are build by defining the relationships, forms, views, business rules, and more at the data layer in Dataverse.*** There is no need to worry about choosing the app size; it is responsive, meaning it works on mobile or tablet with no extra work. Providing  enough control to get to the business result without writing all of the formulas.

#### 3. Portals

***Portals are externally facing websites***. Build an anonymous or authenticated website with the Power Apps interface, that allows users to interact with data held in Dataverse. 

### Artificial Intelligence

***Power Apps has "democratized" artificial intelligence by providing a wizard-based interface for building and training a model***. 

**Currently 4 models:**

- **Prediction** - ***predicts a yes or no outcome***. 
- **Form processor** - ***extracts text from an image***
- **Object detector** - ***identify objects from an image***
- **Text classification** - ***categorizes text by its meaning***

### The Prediction Model

***This is a model that can predict yes or no outcomes based on historical data***. Train the model by providing historical data that includes the yes/no outcome and then artificial intelligence does the rest.

### Security and Administration

***Power Apps has a multitude of security, governance, and reporting capabilities to let you manage Power Apps. Users cannot build apps to bypass current access permissions***. To manage security for Power Apps, you can access https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/. 

***Power Apps also has its own set of PowerShell cmdlets for app creators, administrators, and developers that allow you to automate many of your administrative duties***. A common use case of the PowerShell cmdlets is to automate the discovery and permission management of all apps in your tenant, allowing you to better understand and manage apps as they are created and spread throughout your company.

***Power Automate also has the ability to automate tasks using flows***. 

### Driving business value

***If you know your business process, you can get started writing your first app.*** ***Reduce paperwork by building apps with ease, while staying within the guardrails set by IT***. The same way Finance builds their own Excel workbooks today, even the most entry level users can build their own Power Apps.
