2. **Empower your subject matter experts**. Your SMEs can create chatbots quickly and easily using a novel, intuitive, code-free graphical interface, eliminating the need for AI expertise or teams of developers.

3. **Enable rich, natural conversations.** Microsoftâ€™s powerful conversational AI capabilities enable your end users to have rich multi-turn conversations that quickly guide them to the right solution. 

4. **Enable chatbots to take action.** With Power Virtual Agents, you can easily integrate with services and back-end systems out-of-the-box or through hundreds of easy-to-add custom connectors using Power Automate. This makes it simple to create a chatbot that not only responds to the user, but also acts on their behalf.

5. **Monitor and improve chatbot performance.** Track how chatbots are performing using powerful metrics and AI-driven dashboards. See which topics are doing well and where the chatbot can improve.


6. **Better together.** Power Virtual Agents works hand-in-hand with Dynamics 365 Customer Service Insights to provide a holistic view of your customer service operations.

## Components of Power Virtual Agents

***When you create chatbots with Power Virtual Agents, you author and edit topics.*** ***Topics are discrete conversation paths that, when used together within a single chatbot, allow for users to have a conversation with a chatbot that feels natural and flows appropriately.*** 

### Topics

***A topic defines how a chatbot conversation plays out***. You can author topics by customizing provided templates, create new topics from scratch, or get suggestions from existing help sites. 

**A topic consists of:**

- **trigger phrases** - ***phrases, keywords, or questions related to that topic*** 
- **conversation nodes** - ***define how a chatbot should respond and what it should do.*** 

### Entities

***A big part in Power Virtual Agents is natural language understanding, the ability to understand a user's intent. One fundamental aspect is to identify "entities", information units, in a dialog.*** An entity can be viewed as an information unit that represents a certain type of a real-world subject, like a phone number, zip code, city, or even a person's name.

#### Prebuilt entities

***PVA comes with prebuilt entities, which represent the most commonly used information in real-world dialogs, such as age, colors, numbers, and names.*** With the knowledge granted by entities, a chatbot can smartly recognize the relevant information from a user input and save it for later use.

#### Custom entities

***When building a chatbot that serves a specific purpose, the language understanding model needs to be trained to understand domain-specific knowledge.***

### Actions

***Enable your chatbot to perform an action by calling a Microsoft Power Automate flow.*** Flows can help you automate activities or call backend systems. For example, you can use flows with end-user authentication to retrieve information about a user after they sign in.

***Flows can be called from within topics, as a discrete 'Call an action node'.*** You can utilize flows that have already been created in your Power Apps environment, or you can create a flow from within the Power Virtual Agents authoring canvas.

> **Important**
>
> A flow can only be called from a topic located in the same **Microsoft Dataverse environment** as your chatbot. Flows must also be in a solution in Power Automate. You can **move flows into solutions,** so they are listed in the authoring canvas.

***Flows typically use variables to input and output information. The variables can then be used in other nodes within the topic.***

### Publishing

***PVA can be published to engage with customers on multiple platforms or channels.*** These include live websites, mobile apps, and messaging platforms like Microsoft Teams and Facebook. After you have published at least once, you can connect your chatbot to additional channels.

***Each time there is an update for the chatbot, publish it again from within the Power Virtual Agents app.*** This will update the chatbot across all the channels where you've inserted or connected your chatbot.

***It is possible for a chatbot to provide authentication capabilities***, so users can sign in with any OAuth2 identity provider, such as Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), a Microsoft account, or Facebook.
