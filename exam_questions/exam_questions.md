You need to share the Power BI dashboard with coworkers.
What are three possible ways to achieve the goal? Each correct answer presents a complete solution.
NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

- A. Create a Power BI workspace and grant coworkers permissions.

- C. Export the data into Common Data Service for others to manipulate in Power BI.
- D. Export the data to Microsoft Excel for coworkers to import and view in Power BI.
- E. Embed reports in your company's internal web portal.

> **Discussion**
>
> My Notes: C and D would always be out of date data
>
> Community notes:
>
> "B. Publish the dashboard as an app to your coworkers." Workspaces are published as apps, not Dashboards directly. You need to account for what else is in the workspace before determining if you want to publish it, or create a new separate workspace for any application that you will share
>
> "B. Publish the dashboard as an app to your coworkers." Since when this capability is added to Power BI? Can we publish dashboard in power bi? The Power BI Desktop application only allows you to build and publish reports. Once you have published this to the Web Service, you can then create dashboards there. An easy way is to simply start pinning visuals from any report page. https://community.powerbi.com/t5/Desktop/How-to-publish-a-dashboard/m-p/170688

> A: Basic Sharing for Dashboards and Reports through a workspace is the most common way of sharing the Power BI content. Basic Sharing is very simple and easy to use method. You can simply click on the Share button in the dashboard or report, and then share it with other users.
> ![img](0007100001.png)
> B: Apps are great sharing method for multiple environment, and best way of sharing for users in production environment.
> Power BI App is the solution for multiple environment approach. With Power BI App, your development environment (workspace), and user environment (App) are isolated from each other.
> Note: If you are using SharePoint online as a portal for document management and some other reasons already, then consider using Embed in SharePoint Online feature of Power BI reports. This method is secure and you can share the report only with Power BI users you want.
> E: Sometimes, you donג€™t need a secure way of sharing, you may search for an easy and free way of sharing, and your content is not confidential or sensitive.
> Publish to web is your friend in such situation. This is the only free way of sharing in Power BI, but be aware that this method is not secure.
> Publish to web method, gives you an embed code, which you can use in any web pages to embed the Power BI report in it
